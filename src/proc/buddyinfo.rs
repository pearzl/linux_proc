//! > This file is used primarily for diagnosing memory fragmentation issues. 
//! > Using the buddy algorithm, each column represents the number of pages of a certain order (a certain size) that are available at any given time. 
//! > For example, for zone DMA (direct memory access), there are 90 of 2^(0*PAGE_SIZE) chunks of memory. 
//! > Similarly, there are 6 of 2^(1*PAGE_SIZE) chunks, and 2 of 2^(2*PAGE_SIZE) chunks of memory available.
//! > 
//! > The `DMA` row references the first 16 MB on a system, the `HighMem` row references all memory greater than 4 GB on a system, and the `Normal` row references all memory in between.

//! > This file contains information which is used for diagnosing memory fragmentation issues.
//! > Each line starts with the identification of the node and the name of the zone which together identify a memory region 
//! > This is then followed by the count of available chunks of a certain order in which these zones are split. 
//! > The size in bytes of a certain order is given by the formula:
//! > (2^order) * PAGE_SIZE
//! 
//! > The binary buddy allocator algorithm inside the kernel will split one chunk into two chunks of a smaller order 
//! > (thus with half the size) or combine two contiguous chunks into one larger chunk of a higher order 
//! > (thus with double the size) to satisfy allocation requests and to counter memory fragmentation. 
//! > The order matches the column number, when starting to count at zero.
//! > For example on an x86-64 system:
//! > ```text
//! > Node 0, zone     DMA     1    1    1    0    2    1    1    0    1    1    3
//! > Node 0, zone   DMA32    65   47    4   81   52   28   13   10    5    1  404
//! > Node 0, zone  Normal   216   55  189  101   84   38   37   27    5    3  587
//! > ``` 
//! > 
//! > In this example, there is one node containing three zones and there are 11 different chunk sizes. 
//! > If the page size is 4 kilobytes, then the first zone called DMA (on x86 the first 16 megabyte of memory)
//! > has 1 chunk of 4 kilobytes (order 0) available and has 3 chunks of 4 megabytes (order 10) available.
//! > If the memory is heavily fragmented, the counters for higher order chunks will be zero 
//! > and allocation of large contiguous areas will fail.
//! > Further information about the zones can be found in /proc/zoneinfo.
